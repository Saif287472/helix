# Orbit: deviations from the prototype

Anything the Flutter port cannot match, or deliberately does not match, in the
HTML prototype. One entry per difference, newest last.

**The prototype is the specification.** This file is not a backlog of things to
"improve" — it is the list of places where the port had to differ, so the owner
can approve each one. A difference that is not written here is a difference
nobody checked.

Format:

```markdown
## <screen or component> — <one line>

- **Prototype:** what `orbit/prototype/` draws (`js/screens/*.js`,
  `css/*.css`, the screen's entry in `SCREENS.md`).
- **Flutter:** what was built instead, and where
  (`packages/orbit_ui/lib/...`).
- **Why:** why the prototype cannot be matched. "Flutter has no equivalent" is
  only an answer when it says what was done instead.
- **Owner:** approved / pending.
```

## Italic faces are real, where the prototype's are synthesised

- **Prototype (before 2026-10-18):** `prototype/index.html` line 11 asked
  Google Fonts for an italic face for Fraunces only. For the other families the browser **synthesises** an
  oblique when it meets `font-style: italic`, and the prototype does draw
  italic — bloom's wordmark, the typing indicator, placeholder bubbles, a
  missing quote.
- **Flutter:** the real italic face of every family that has one is bundled
  (`orbit/flutter/fonts/MANIFEST.md`: 13 files). Cinzel, Rajdhani, Share Tech
  Mono and Black Ops One have no upstream italic, so nothing is synthesised for
  them.
- **Why:** Flutter does not reliably synthesise an oblique for a custom font. If
  the real faces were not bundled, every italic line would render **upright**
  and the compare tool would report a difference on all of them — noise that
  hides real differences.
- **Consequence, accepted:** a real italic is still not a synthetic one. The
  faces carry their own slant angles (−7° Barlow to −17.2° EB Garamond) and
  their own advance widths, so italic text will differ slightly from the
  prototype's screenshots. That residual is smaller and more truthful than
  rendering upright, and it is the design's own intention rather than a
  substitute.
- **Owner:** approved 2026-10-18, resolved: the prototype now loads the same
  real italic faces (index.html line 11), so both sides draw the same italics
  and the compare tool measures like with like.

## Icons are Phosphor's own font files, not the `phosphor_flutter` package

- **Prototype:** Phosphor Icons 2.1.1 from unpkg, as icon fonts (`ph`,
  `ph-fill`, `ph-bold`, `ph-light`, `ph-duotone`).
- **Flutter:** the same icons from the same Phosphor font files, bundled in
  `orbit_ui` (`fonts/phosphor/`, MIT licence alongside) and declared as
  `const IconData` in `packages/orbit_ui/lib/src/icons/orbit_icons.dart`, so
  release builds still tree-shake the icon fonts.
- **Why:** `PORT_PLAN.md` named `phosphor_flutter`. Its newest release (2.1.0)
  declares `class PhosphorIconData extends IconData`, and `IconData` is
  `final` in Flutter 3.44, so the package does not compile, and upgrading
  Flutter is not allowed. The glyphs and code points are unchanged; only the
  Dart wrapper is ours.
- **Owner:** approved 2026-10-18, on the conditions above (recorded here,
  `const IconData`, licence kept).

## The logo is drawn as paths, not loaded as an SVG

- **Prototype:** `prototype/assets/orbit-mark.svg`, as a CSS background.
- **Flutter:** `OrbitMark` (`packages/orbit_ui/lib/src/brand/orbit_mark.dart`)
  paints the same rectangle, gradient, arcs and circles from the SVG's own
  numbers.
- **Why:** Flutter has no SVG renderer, and `flutter_svg` is a dependency the
  app does not have; `orbit_ui` must move into `helix_remote` unchanged. The
  compare tool shows the drawn mark matching the prototype's to within
  anti-aliasing.
- **Owner:** approved 2026-10-18 (Review 2).
